AI Modding Suite — Suggestions and Next Steps
Date: 2025-09-18T10:41:58Z
Path: D:\Ai_modding_Suite vrs 1
Scope: No code changes performed. This doc proposes actions only.

Priority key: P0 = immediate clarity/low effort, P1 = enable progress, P2 = polish/scale
Effort key: S = small, M = medium, L = large

P0 (S) Source–artifact reconciliation
- Decide whether dist/modding_suite.exe is canonical. If yes, locate or recover the source that produced it so future changes are maintainable.
- If source cannot be located, plan for a minimal rebuild path from the current stub plus newly added code.

P0 (S) Define workspace and pathing model
- Choose a base workspace directory schema on disk aligned with your taxonomy (Intake, Deployment, Reference, Staging).
- Capture this in a simple config (even a JSON or INI) and have the app read it (later), instead of hard-coding paths.

P0 (S) Document the build/run toolchain baseline (no code yet)
- Target Python 3.12.x on Windows 11.
- GUI: PyQt6 (stay unless licensing or ABI constraints require PySide6).
- Packager: PyInstaller 6.x.

P1 (S) Make the current GUI minimally runnable (when you’re ready for code changes)
- Add a main entry point creating QApplication, instantiating ModdingSuite, and app.exec().
- Complete save_mod_file with UTF-8 write and basic overwrite confirmation.
- Implement clear_editor to clear QTextEdit and reset state.

P1 (S) Add dependency manifest and basic docs
- requirements.txt: pin PyQt6 to a stable minor; add any standard utilities as needed.
- README.md: quick start, run instructions, packaging notes.

P1 (M) Plan validation/repair architecture
- Define “AI Validation & Fixes”: start with deterministic rule-based validators (schema/format checks for mod files). Add ML/AI later if needed.
- Separate UI from validation logic (module/package); consider a simple pipeline interface: load → validate → repair → export, with structured results.

P1 (M) Threading and responsiveness plan
- Long-running validation must run in a worker thread (QThread or QRunnable/QThreadPool). UI signals/slots update progress, prevent blocking.

P1 (M) Backups and audit trail
- On save/repair, preserve originals to a structured backup path (per your taxonomy). Keep a simple change log per file (JSON with timestamps/operations).
- Later, import these historical backups/changelogs into git once you decide to initialize version control.

P2 (M) Normalize the taxonomy in code and on disk
- Provide a small module that maps logical areas (Intake, UPC, Creation Library, Deployment) to actual directories, with validation and creation helpers.
- Use QStandardPaths for user-facing defaults on Windows; allow override via config.

P2 (M) Packaging and release hygiene
- Provide a documented PyInstaller command and (optionally) a .spec file for reproducible builds.
- Smoke test packaged app launch on a clean Windows VM.

P2 (L) Future expansions (aligned with your docs)
- Unified Parts Catalogue (UPC): schemas, metadata tagging, importers for textures/models/scripts.
- Cross-Reference Tools: component links and conversion methods.
- Deployment: scenario templates, compatibility patches, export routines.
- Creation Library: AI-generated designs integration points.

Notes on PyQt6 rationale and alternatives
- Stay with PyQt6: it’s a solid fit for Windows desktop packaging and you already have a UI stub.
- Consider PySide6 only if licensing (LGPL) is required or if binary compatibility becomes an issue. Switching later is feasible but not free (API mostly compatible but packaging/test cycle needed).

Open questions to resolve before coding
- Confirm the canonical source for the existing executable.
- Define the initial set of validation rules (human-readable spec for mod formats you target).
- Decide the base workspace directory for the taxonomy on end-user machines.

When you’re ready, I can translate this into minimal, review-friendly diffs that implement the P1 (S) items first.
